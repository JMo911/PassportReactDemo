# ValetX
[Try our app here](https://passportreactdemo.herokuapp.com/)


## Purpose
* The purpose of this app is to speed up the valet process for both the guest and valet.
* It will replace the valet ticketing system and payment system.
* It will resolve the problems that  these systems have which slows down the process of car retrieval and payment.

## Problems with the existing system
* Tickets & wait times - tickets are bulky and easy to use. Valets can write 1,000+ tickets for a busy event. It's easy to duplicate tickets, misplace tickets, or forget to mark the parking spot for a vehicle. Guests have no way to call for their car ahead of time. 
* Tipping is ambiguous and there are no suggestions. We will have an obvious tip prompt with suggested amounts for our patrons to conveniently decide on a tip from there phone. 
* There are no estimated wait times for your car. 

## Our Solution
* One click - Guest can click one button to pay which shows price, tip and prompt to retrieve car.
* Queue with wait times - Our app puts guests in a queue so they can see how many cars are ahead of them and an estimated wait time until their car will be ready.
* Guest feedback - Instant feedback using star rating system upon guests' departure.

### Company Benefits
* Thousands saved - No longer have to purchase tickets to track guests using your valet service.
⋅⋅* Less staff needed - No need for a cashier to take guest payments.
* Happy guests - Easier, faster, and more informative valet system.  
* Happy valets - Easier system that includes private tip prompt to guests. No need for awkward non-tipping situations.
